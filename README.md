# Face Emotion Detection using CNN

This project is a **Face Emotion Detection** system built using **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)**. The model predicts human facial emotions from images in real-time or from static images.

---

## 🧠 Features
- Detects 7 basic facial emotions:  
  - Happy  
  - Sad  
  - Angry  
  - Surprise  
  - Fear  
  - Disgust  
  - Neutral
- Works on both **images** and **real-time webcam input**
- Lightweight and efficient CNN model
- Easy to integrate into applications

---

## 📂 Dataset
- Trained on [RAF-DB / FER2013 / your dataset]  
- Dataset includes labeled images for the 7 emotion classes  
- Images were **resized and normalized** for training

---

## 🖥️ Requirements
- Python 3.8+
- TensorFlow / Keras
- OpenCV
- NumPy
- Matplotlib (optional, for visualization)

You can install dependencies using:

```bash
